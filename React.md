***Introduction***

### 1. What is React?
React is a `front-end and open-source JavaScript library` which is useful in developing applications with a `single page`.
 It is helpful in building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components of `mobile and web applications` as it follows the `component-based approach`.


The important features of React are:
-It supports `server-side rendering`.
-It will make use of the `virtual DOM` rather than real DOM (Data Object Model) as RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
-It follows `unidirectional` data binding or data flow.
-It uses `reusable UI components` for developing the view.
