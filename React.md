### Introduction
- React is an `open-source JavaScript framework` library that allows developers to the creation of simple, fast, and scalable web applications.
- `Jordan Walke`, a software engineer who was working for Facebook created React. 
- It was first deployed on the news feed of Facebook in `2011` and on Instagram in `2012`.

### 1) What is React?
React is a `front-end and open-source JavaScript library` which is useful in developing applications with a `single page`.
 It is helpful in building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components of `mobile and web applications` as it follows the `component-based approach`.


_The important features of React are:_  
-It supports `server-side rendering`.  
-It will make use of the `virtual DOM` rather than real DOM (Data Object Model) as RealDOM manipulations are expensive.  
-It follows `unidirectional` data binding or data flow.  
-It uses `reusable UI components` for developing the view.  

### 2) What are the advantages of using React?

***Use of Virtual DOM to improve efficiency:***  
 Each time the `data changes` in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created.  
 `Creating a virtual DOM is much faster` than rendering the UI inside the browser. Therefore, with the use of virtual DOM, the efficiency of the app improves.
 ***Gentle learning curve:***  
 Compare to other framework like Angular its easy to learn  
 ***SEO friendly:***  (Search Engine Optimization)  
   It also allows server-side rendering, which boosts the SEO of an app.  
***Reusable components:***  
***Huge ecosystem of libraries to choose from:***  
 React provides you with the `freedom to choose the tools, libraries, and architecture` for developing an application based on your requirement.  

### 3) What are the limitations of React?
